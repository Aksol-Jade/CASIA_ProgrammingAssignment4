# CASIA Programming Assignment 4

This notebook contains the fourth assignment for the CASIA behavioral computing course. It explores pattern classification using facial expression features and evaluates multiple supervised machine learning models.

## 🎯 Objective
To develop and compare classification models using CASIA dataset features. The goal is to identify the most accurate method for predicting categorical expression outcomes.

## 🧩 Covered Topics
- Feature exploration and visualization
- Preprocessing for classification
- Training and comparing classifiers:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Trees

## 🔍 Notebook Highlights
- Read and clean structured input data
- Encode labels and standardize features
- Train/test split for evaluation
- Use metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
- Graphical evaluation with Seaborn and Matplotlib

## 🧠 Insights
- Performance comparison between models
- Observation of class imbalance or confusion patterns
- Recommendations for improving classification (feature selection, resampling, etc.)

## 🛠️ Dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 📁 How to Run
1. Ensure dataset file is in the working directory
2. Open `CASIA_ProgrammingAssignment4.ipynb`
3. Execute all cells to generate model training and evaluation outputs

## 📄 License
For academic use only. Dataset rights remain with CASIA or your institution.
